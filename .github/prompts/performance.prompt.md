How can I make this code more performant? Always prefer readability over performance. Avoid things like .configureAwait(false) and avoid approaches that increase the degree of parallelism or manipulate thread settings. You may use constructs like await Parallel.ForEachAsync, but do not increase the default parallelism or thread count. Focus on improving the algorithm, reducing memory usage, and optimizing data structures.
